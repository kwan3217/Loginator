3/16/2013 Flight 1

Site: Alpine Elementary field
Weather: Overcast, calm winds during flight, weather at KCOLONGM64 51.5f 29.97 in 6.7mph 49%RH

Forgot to pull cap from launch rod before flight. Minor ding to rocket nose cone only damage. Flew straight, seemed to turn level to ground at apogee, I could see a yellow tinge to the tracking smoke. Parachute ejected but never deployed. Rocket fell free from apogee. No damage at impact. Rocketometer was still running after flight.

Rocketometer has one file as expected, RKTO0500.SDS 35,369,984 bytes. Indicates that Rocketometer was running through whole flight.

Switch and card not glued into place. Reset solder bridge in place. 

Rocketometer on internal power ~11:50am

Nautilus reports weird file sizes for files. fsck.vfat does not report any filesystem errors.
