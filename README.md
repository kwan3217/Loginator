The [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/8627 Sparkfun Logomatic] is a single-board computer marketed as a data logger. When I got mine, it didn't take me long to realize that this was a much more powerful computer, capable of such things as robot control. I took the original hardware design and made several derivative boards, including one which has been in space, one which has logged data on rollercoasters around the country, and one which has been to Europe and back.

This code is a complete rewrite of the firmware in C++. All original Sparkfun code has been replaced. Having said that, in the spirit of Open Source, the software is GPL 3.0 because I choose it to be, and the hardware design is CC-BY-SA because it is still derived from the original Sparkfun design.
